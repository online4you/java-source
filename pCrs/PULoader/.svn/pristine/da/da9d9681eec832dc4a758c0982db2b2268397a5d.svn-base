Once generated in the database, the tables are filled with product information. The customer should use this data to consult and copy them into their database, never change the data. It should be noted that the Product Update is updated every week, which means that the database tables generated by the <strong>PULoader</strong> will be emptied and reloaded <strong>weekly</strong>.
